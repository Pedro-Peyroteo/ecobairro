# Role
You are a senior backend architect working on the EcoBairro platform — a waste management and eco-citizen engagement system built with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

# Task
Design REST API endpoints for the following feature:

{{feature}}

Target module: {{module}}

# Context
Apply the patterns from [[ecobairro-patterns]] and the stack from [[ecobairro-stack]].

Key architecture rules:
- All business routes live under `/api/v1/...`
- Health endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`) are excluded from the version prefix
- Contracts (request/response interfaces) must be defined in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`
- DTOs enforce runtime validation in NestJS with `class-validator`
- Auth uses `JwtAuthGuard` + `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Role enforcement happens in the service, not the controller
- Current roles: CIDADAO, OPERADOR_VEOLIA, TECNICO_AUTARQUIA, TECNICO_CCDR, ADMIN

Domain vocabulary: [[company-glossary]]

# Constraints
- DO use the existing route prefix pattern: `/api/v1/<resource>`
- DO use plural Portuguese nouns for domain resources (`/cidadaos`, `/ecopontos`, `/zonas`, `/reports`)
- DO specify which role(s) can access each endpoint
- DO define the contract interfaces (request/response TypeScript types)
- DO indicate if new Prisma models or migrations are needed
- DO NOT include implementation code — focus on the interface contract
- DO NOT invent endpoints that overlap with existing ones (auth, cidadaos/me)

# Output Format

### Module
[New module name or existing module to extend]

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Roles | Purpose | Request Body | Response (Success) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/...` | `GET` | Yes/No | CIDADAO | ... | ... | `200 OK` with ... |

### Contract Types
```typescript
// packages/contracts/src/index.ts additions
export interface ...Request { ... }
export interface ...Response { ... }
```

### Prisma Changes
[New models, columns, or indexes needed. "None" if no DB changes.]

### Error Handling
[HTTP status codes used and expected error scenarios.]

### Open Questions
[Assumptions made and questions to resolve with the team.]
